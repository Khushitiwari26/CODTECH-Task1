##Overview of the Project

###Project:
The objective of this project is to implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the Boston housing dataset for training and evaluation.
I had used California housing dataset instead of Boston housing dataset to complete my task.
